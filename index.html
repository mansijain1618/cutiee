    <h2>How We Became Lovers</h2>
    <p>
      It all began when you sent me a request on Instagram back in 2023. We started chatting... and on 8th Feb 2024, Proposal Day, you told me you liked me. I said no. But you still said we could be friends — kind, gentle as always.
      Still, I blocked you. I waited for your message on my birthday... but how could it come when I had you blocked?
      Twice, I dreamt of you — Sanskar. Missed you. Then one day, a message came from a fake ID — "Why did you do this to Sanskar? He's such a good soul." That broke me.
      I unblocked you, messaged you with a screenshot. You replied late... and rudely. I thought you hated me now. But then, you said sorry.
      We talked for 3 days... then silence again. Slowly, we reconnected. Real WhatsApp number shared, voice calls, smiles, late night talks.
      On your birthday, I wished you at midnight — expecting you'd be too busy to even see my text. But you replied *within seconds*.
      Then came 21st December. We spoke till 4am. I sat outside in the cold, talking to you, phone in hand, stars above, heart full.
      From reels to raw, deep talks — our "bro code" phase. Feelings grew without warning. Every time you joked about your future wife... my heart sank.
      Then came the big moment: You told me to visit Kundalpur on New Year’s... and I did.
      After aarti, you called me. Twice. And when I turned around — you were there. Smiling. Glowing. Divine.
      You touched my mom’s feet, stood beside me... and I swear, in that one second, time stood still. You were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
      That night, I messaged you... opened up everything I was afraid to say. And on 5th Jan 2025 — while travelling — I confessed it all.
